# Angular todo-app
Simple CRUD application in form of todo-list app made in Angular. Main reason for creating this app was to familiarize myself with Angular Routing, working with http requests in Angular using rxjs library. App uses Bootstrap for styling and mobile view. [JSON server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server) has been for mocking the backend.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/u5s10/angular_todo-app.git
git cd angular_todo-app
npm install
```

## Running

```npm
ng serve
json-server --watch db.json
```
After running `ng serve` Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
